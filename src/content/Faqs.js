        question:"How do we register?",
        answer:"- Please go to the events page where you will have to fill up google forms of the event that you wish to participate in. If you are an IIITB student, you do not have to pay for the events. But if you aren't a student of IIITB, then you will have to go to the description section provided in the form, there you'll find the link to the payment portal, pay the amount and take a screen shot of the payment receipt and submit that screen shot in the form."
    },
    {
        question:"How do I verify my identity in college events? ",
        answer:"- If you are an IIITB student, then carry your ID card. If you are not an IIITB student, then we'll verify your payment and provide you the tickets via the email id you've provided in form. That will be considered as your identity verification. "
    },
    {
        question:"Should I buy a ticket for individual events, or can I get a single ticket for all the events?",
        answer:"One ticket for any of the events is enough to get you into the college for the day the event is happening, but for participating in any other event, you would still have to pay."
    },
    {
        question:"How will I get updates of the events?",
        answer:"You can get updates of each event by contacting one of the SPOCS of the event or by following @infin8_iiitb on Instagram."
    },
    {
        question:"Are there sponsorship opportunities for businesses or organisations?",
