        question:"How do we register?",
        answer:"Visit the events page and fill out the Google Form for the event you wish to participate in. A QR code is available in the form. Non-IIITB students should scan the QR code, complete the payment, take a screenshot of the receipt, and submit it through the form. IIITB students are exempt from event fees; however, they should also upload a picture of their student ID as part of the registration process."
    },
    {
        question:"How do I verify my identity in college events? ",
        answer:"If you are an IIITB student, please carry your ID card. For non-IIITB students, we will verify your payment and send you the tickets to the email address you provided in the form. This email confirmation will be considered as your identity verification"
    },
    {
        question:"Should I buy a ticket for individual events, or can I get a single ticket for all the events?",
        answer:"One ticket for any of the events is enough to get you into the college for the day the event is happening, but for participating in any other event, you would still have to pay."
    },
    {
        question:"How will I get updates of the events?",
        answer:"You can get updates of each event by contacting one of the SPOCS of the event or by following @infin8_iiitb on Instagram."
    },
    {
        question:"Are there sponsorship opportunities for businesses or organisations?",
        answer:"Yes, there are many. You can contact us at sac@iiitb.ac.in for more details."
